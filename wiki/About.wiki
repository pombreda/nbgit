= About Git =

Git is an open source version control system designed to scale from small to very large projects in terms of speed and efficiency. Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools which means that a Git repository is a full-fledged copy with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server. Still, Git stays extremely fast and space efficient.

=== About NbJGit ===
