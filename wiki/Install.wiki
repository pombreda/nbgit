= Installing and Updating =

Before installing or updating make sure you read the [News release notes] and [Issues list of known issues].

=== Installing and updating using !NetBeans module archives ===

The easiest way to install is to install the plugin from a .nbm file:

 * [http://code.google.com/p/nbgit/downloads/list?q=label:Type-Nbm List of .nbm files available for download]

After downloading the .nbm file do the following:

 # Open the _Tools > Plugins_ dialog.
 # Choose the _Downloaded_ tab.
 # Press the _Add Plugins..._ button and specify the path to the downloaded .nbm file.
 # Click _Install_.

=== Installing and updating from source ===

To install from source first get the source code either from a git repository or from a source code archive.

 * [http://code.google.com/p/nbgit/downloads/list?q=label:Type-Source List of source code archives available for download]
 
 * [http://code.google.com/p/nbgit/wiki/Source List of versioned repositories]

Then follow these steps:

 # Clone the repository or unpack the archive, depending on how you choose to get the source.
 # Open the project using the _File > Open Project_ wizard.
 # Optionally, but highly recommended, right click on the nbgit project and select _Run_ to test the plugin.
 # Right click on the nbgit project and select _Install/Reload in Development IDE_.
